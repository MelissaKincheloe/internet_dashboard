Percentage
==========

Purpose
-------

A widget that displays a percentage values from IMon Data as colored icons/100 icons - either the latest available data per country/indicator or data per a chosen year.

Visualization
-------------

The icons are [font-awesome](fontawesome.io/icons/) icons, usually a 'user' icon but in specific cases (until the API better reflects this so it's automated), different icons. See Settings.icons in [imon_percent.js](imon_percent.js).

Icon sizes are calculated based on a maximum size and whether or not there is overflow.
