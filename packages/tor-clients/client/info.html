<template name="TorClientsInfo">
  <p>
    Tor clients connect to many intermediate nodes before connecting to the
    intended destination, but there are two types of nodes the client can
    connect to first:
  </p>
  <dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>relay</dt>
    <dd>a publicly-listed node in the Tor network that forwards traffic on
    behalf of clients, and that registers itself with the directory
    authorities</dd>
    <dt>bridge</dt>
    <dd>a relay whose existence is non-public and which can therefore provide
    access for blocked clients</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    This widget displays the appoximate daily number of connections to each
    of these first-node types for a specific country over the last
    {{ windowLength }} days.
