Collections
-----------
One for each widget.
One for each widget data source?
Does that just get determined by the widget author?

Dashboards
Users (for being an admin)
Widgets (for globally enabling or disabling and showing in "add" lists)
Countries


Working
-------
Widgets have country options
All countries conform to the same ISO 2 or 3
Widgets are taggable

Use a lot of Template.registerHelpers?

Widgets should provide a single export
What would that export need to provide?

Look here for examples: https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages/accounts-ui-unstyled
Possibly:
  each widget can contain three templates: widget body, options, about
  we pick where those get rendered
  export provides template names as properties
  export provides function to call when country changes
  export provides URL
  export provides width and height
