Internet Monitor Dashboard
==========================

Description
-----------

The Internet Monitor Dashboard lets you explore, create, customize, and share dashboards of data visualizations about multiple facets of the Internet.

Code Repository
---------------

We keep our code at https://github.com/berkmancenter/internet_dashboard. You're probably looking at it right now.

Requirements
------------

To get this up and running, you'll need a computer with Linux, OS X, or Windows. Meteor should take care of the rest. Their install docs are [here](https://www.meteor.com/install). See more in our Getting Started guide in `docs/getting_started.md`.

Tested Configurations
---------------------

We've successfully run this on Ubuntu 14.10 and 15.04 with Meteor 1.1.0.2, but it should run fine on any platform Meteor supports.

User Documentation
------------------

User docs are a TODO. We've tried to keep most of the helpful text in the app itself.

Running Tests
-------------

We don't have any tests yet and are suitable ashamed.

Deployment
----------

Deploying Meteor apps can be tricky. We're in the process of putting together a deployment guide.

Issue Tracker
-------------

While this project is still in its nascent stages, we're using a closed-to-the-public issue tracker, but we pay attention to the public issue tracker [on Github](https://github.com/berkmancenter/internet_dashboard/issues).

Contributing
------------

We welcome any and all contributions! First, check the public [issue tracker](https://github.com/berkmancenter/internet_dashboard/issues) to make sure no one else is already working on the thing you're interested in, and then see our Getting Started guide at `docs/getting_started.md`.
